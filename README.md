# ACE:Diablo1

## Purpose
ACE:Diablo1 is a third party tool built ontop of my [ACE engine](https://github.com/Stromner/ACE) that allows you to edit Diablo1 character files however you want, which does include cheating.

## Usage
**DO NOT USE ON A FILE THAT IS CURRENTLY IN GAME** - That is a surefire way to corrupt your save file

* Load your save file (java -jar <**jar file**>) and edit away! 
  * [Where do I find my save file?](http://www.bigd-online.com/JG/Body/JG10.html)
* When done make sure to save it back to your system or the changes will be discarded when you exit the program.

## For devs
